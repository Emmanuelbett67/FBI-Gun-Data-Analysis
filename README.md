# FBI-Gun-Data-Analysis
The purpose of this project is to explore the trends of U.S gun purchases with census population data.
### The goal of this project:
- Ask questions such as what census data is most associated with high gun per capita?
- Clean & merge FBI-gun data with census data altogether
- Answers the questions accordingly
- Visualize the combined data to draw conclusions
### The data
The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov.
